        "\n",
        "- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity with specific attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",

        "# Class definition\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",

        "# Accessing the method of the object\n",
        "my_car.display_info()\n",

        "### Q2. **Name the four pillars of OOPs.**\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) together into a single unit or class.\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features of the object.\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class.\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: The ability to define methods that behave differently based on the object that calls them.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Q4. **Why `self` is used in OOPs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The keyword `self` refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within its methods. Every method in a class takes `self` as its first parameter so that it can refer to the instance that calls the method.\n",
